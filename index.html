    <h1><u>Educational Resources</u></h1>
    <p>Below are some resources that you can use if you are a beginner or new to blockchain technology.</p>
    <h2><u>Introduction to blockchain technology</u></h2>
    <p>What is blockchain technology? What makes it so important?</p>

    <p>Imagine a world where you can send money directly to someone without a bank in seconds instead of days, and you
        do not pay exorbitant bank fees.</p>

    <p>Or one where you store money in an online wallet not tied to a bank, meaning you are your own bank and have
        complete control over your money. You do not need permission from a bank to access or move it, and never have to
        worry about a third party taking it away, or an economic policy of a government manipulating it.</p>

    <p>This is not a world of the future; it is a world that an avid but growing number of early adopters live in right
        now. And these are just a few of the important blockchain technology use cases that are transforming the way we
        trust and exchange value. We will get into the rest later on.</p>

    <p>Yet, for many, blockchain technology is still a mysterious or even intimidating topic. Some even remain skeptical
        that we will use this technology in the future. This skepticism that exists today is understandable because we
        are still very early in the development and widespread adoption of blockchain technology.</p>

    <p>2021 is to blockchain what the late 1990s were to the internet. And like the internet, blockchain technology is
        anything but a fad, it is here to stay, and if you are reading this, you are early too.</p>

    <p>This post demystifies blockchain technology. This is your intro to blockchain technology 101. A complete,
        easy-to-understand, step by step beginners blockchain breakdown. You will learn everything from what blockchain
        is and why it matters, to how blockchain works (step by step) and what the most promising blockchain
        applications may be today and tomorrow.</p>

    <p>You will also walk away from this post confident, and well on your way to making informed, independent blockchain
        technology investment decisions. And you will be no slouch if you want to hold your own in conversations with
        family
        and friends too!</p>
    <p>So let us dive in.</p>

    <h3><u>Blockchain 101: Blockchain For Beginners</u></h3>
    <p>Blockchain technology is the concept or protocol behind the running of the blockchain. Blockchain technology
        makes
        cryptocurrencies (digital currencies secured by cryptography) like Bitcoin work just like the internet makes
        email
        possible.</p>

    <p>The blockchain is an immutable (unchangeable, meaning a transaction or file recorded cannot be changed)
        distributed
        digital ledger (digital record of transactions or data stored in multiple places on a computer network) with
        many
        use cases beyond cryptocurrencies.</p>

    <p>Immutable and distributed are two fundamental blockchain properties. The immutability of the ledger means you can
        always trust it to be accurate. Being distributed protects the blockchain from network attacks.</p>

    <p>Each transaction or record on the ledger is stored in a “block.” For example, blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain
        consist of an average of more than 500 Bitcoin transactions.</p>

    <p>The information contained in a block is dependent on and linked to the information in a previous block and, over
        time, forms a chain of transactions. Hence the word blockchain.</p>

    <h4><u>Types of Blockchains</u></h4>
    <p>There are four types of blockchains:</p>

    <u>1. Public Blockchains</u>
    <p>Public blockchains are open, decentralized networks of computers accessible to anyone wanting to request or
        validate
        a transaction (check for accuracy). Those (miners) who validate transactions receive rewards.</p>

    <p>Public blockchains use proof-of-work or proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms (discussed later). Two common
        examples
        of public blockchains include the Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains.</p>

    <u>2. Private Blockchains</u>
    <p>Private blockchains are not open, they have access restrictions. People who want to join require permission from
        the
        system administrator. They are typically governed by one entity, meaning they are centralized. For example,
        Hyperledger is a private, permissioned blockchain.</p>

    <u>3. Hybrid Blockchains or Consortiums</u>
    <p>Consortiums are a combination of public and private blockchains and contain centralized and decentralized
        features.
        For example, Energy Web Foundation, Dragonchain, and R3.</p>

    <p>Take note: There is not a 100 percent consensus on whether these are different terms. Some make a distinction
        between the two, while others consider them the same thing.</p>

    <u>4. Sidechains</u>
    <p>A sidechain is a blockchain running parallel to the main chain. It allows users to move digital assets between
        two
        different blockchains and improves scalability and efficiency. An example of a sidechain is the Liquid Network.
